# Alert Dialog Removal - Labor Monitoring

## Changes Made

### âœ… **Removed Success Alerts**

I've removed the following success alert dialogs to provide a cleaner user experience:

1. **"Monitoring entry saved successfully!"** - Removed from `addMonitoringEntry()` function
   - The table updates automatically when an entry is added
   - Visual feedback is provided by seeing the new entry in the table

2. **"Monitoring entry deleted successfully!"** - Removed from `deleteMonitoringEntry()` function  
   - The entry disappears from the table automatically
   - Visual feedback is provided by the entry being removed from view

3. **"PDF saved to patient documents successfully!"** - Removed from `savePDFToPatientDocuments()` function
   - The PDF file downloads automatically to the user's computer
   - Visual feedback is provided by the file download

### ðŸ”’ **Kept Important Alerts**

The following alerts are still in place for important user feedback:

1. **Validation Error**: "Please fill in date, time, and ensure a patient is selected."
2. **Save Error**: "Error saving monitoring entry. Please try again."
3. **Delete Error**: "Error deleting monitoring entry. Please try again." 
4. **PDF Generation Error**: "Error generating PDF. Please try again."
5. **PDF Save Error**: "PDF generated but could not be saved to patient documents..."
6. **PDF Selection Error**: "Please select a patient first."
7. **Delete Confirmation**: Confirmation dialog asking "Are you sure you want to delete..."

## Result

### Before:
- Success dialog appeared every time you added an entry
- Success dialog appeared when deleting entries
- Success dialog appeared when saving PDFs

### After:
- Clean, seamless workflow without interrupting success dialogs
- Visual feedback through automatic table updates
- Error dialogs still appear for important issues
- Confirmation dialogs still appear for destructive actions

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Faster Workflow**: No need to dismiss success dialogs
2. **Less Interruption**: Users can continue working without stopping
3. **Visual Feedback**: Table updates and downloads provide clear feedback
4. **Still Safe**: Error handling and confirmations remain in place

The labor monitoring system now provides a smoother, less intrusive user experience while maintaining important error handling and safety confirmations.
